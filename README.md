# poem_bot
Poem generation with LSTM trained on a Haiku database. A deployed version can be found at http://poemmyface.herokuapp.com/index . That particular model did not learn the Haiku structure as it was trained on only 30 character blocks - hardware ram limitations :(. Therefore I am letting the poems be of somewhat arbitrary lengths. The model did pick up the short property of the haiku's verse.
